            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to AlgoLearn! We take your privacy very seriously and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your data, ensuring that your experience using our app is safe, secure, and respects your privacy.
            </p>
            <p>
                By using AlgoLearn, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. We encourage you to read this policy carefully to understand our practices regarding your information.
            </p>

            <h2>Data Collection</h2>
            <p>
                At AlgoLearn, we do not collect, store, or process any personal information from our users. This means we do not ask for or store data such as your name, email address, phone number, or any other identifiable information. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Our primary goal is to provide you with a learning platform that is both effective and secure. As such, we do not require any personal data for you to use our app. Your experience is fully anonymous, allowing you to learn without concerns about data privacy.
            </p>
            <p>
                We do not track your activities outside the app, nor do we monitor your interactions with other applications or services. Our commitment to user privacy means that you can engage with our educational content without worrying about how your data is being used or shared.
            </p>

            <h2>Non-Personal Information</h2>
            <p>
                Although we do not collect personal information, we may gather non-personal usage data to enhance the performance and functionality of our app. This data may include information on how you interact with the app, such as the features you use, the time spent on various activities, and other similar metrics.
            </p>
            <p>
                This usage data is completely anonymous and cannot be used to identify you as an individual. It helps us understand user behavior and preferences, enabling us to continually improve the app's design and user experience. We may use tools and analytics services to assist with this data collection, but no personal information will be shared or collected.
            </p>
            <p>
                Such data might include the type of device you are using, the operating system version, and basic app interaction metrics. This allows us to optimize performance and ensure a smooth experience for all users. However, rest assured that none of this data can be traced back to you personally.
            </p>

            <p>
                We employ a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your non-personal data, including encryption, secure server facilities, and other security measures. However, please remember that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are committed to regularly reviewing our security measures and adapting to new technologies to maintain a high standard of protection for our users.
